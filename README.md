# Gonzaga_Final_Project
Jumpy game final project


**********Gameplay ideas:
Add more powerups such as speed 
shoot down mobs
add more mobs
make the screen bigger
added a way to change the platforms based on score

**********Bugs
the platforms got clumped together
when you get launched by powerup or head jump player sometimes snaps to platform abruptly 
happens when hitting jump during power up boost
Weren't enough platforms to jump on
the speed powerup wasn't working
the sprites would not show up 

**********Gameplay fixes
More powerup availibity 
fixed speed powerup
Was able to stretch the screen width for more visibility and oppurtunity to add stuff

**********Features
Varied powerups such as speed
Wider screen dimension
Can shoot carrots
change the platforms based on score

Notes: I had problems with changing the speed once you get a powerup. This was hard because I couldn't add to the speed form the main since the 
player acceleration was in the settings
